## 2026-03-12 — Documentation cleanup and navigation index

### Added
- **`docs/README.md`** — navigation index mapping all documentation by audience (Claude, new users, design) and framework files by domain (application, interview, outreach, coaching, templates). The missing "which file do I read for X?" entry point.
- **`Last updated` headers** on 11 docs/framework files — enables the staleness-check logic in the global CLAUDE.md snippet (14-day threshold).

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — trimmed Purpose section from 10-line lifecycle list to one-line pointer to README.md (saves ~200 tokens/session of duplicated content). Updated structure tree: added `coaching/` subdirectories (coached-answers, pressure-points, anti-pattern-tracker, progress-recruiter), changed `docs/` comment to point to new index.
- **`docs/privacy.md`** — added cross-reference to CLAUDE.md Profile Guard section under "What stays local."
- **`framework/outreach-guide.md`** — added precedence note: Nick-specific voice in `style-guidelines.md` overrides generic guidance here.
- **`docs/global-claude-md-snippet.md`** — added scope note: these are project-agnostic patterns; project-specific overrides live in `style-guidelines.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

### Archived
- **`docs/phase2-handoff.md`** → `docs/archive/` — Phase 2 complete (commit `9791808`). No skills reference it.
- **`docs/research-skills-upgrade-summary.md`** → `docs/archive/` — Proposal doc; adopted parts already in CLAUDE.md research standards. Unadopted parts would contradict current standards.

## 2026-03-04 — Opportunity evaluation generators

### Added
- **`tools/generate_belfiore_model.py`** — financial model generator for Belfiore Cheese acquisition thesis with computed economics (not hardcoded); COGS reconciled to 10–18% EBITDA industry benchmarks.
- **`tools/generate_belfiore_pitch.py`** — investor pitch deck generator for Belfiore Cheese.
- **`tools/generate_model.py`** — financial model generator for SF Portable Sanitation thesis (original pattern).
- **`tools/generate_pitch.py`** — investor pitch deck generator for SF Portable Sanitation.
- **`framework/opportunity-evaluation-playbook.md`** — end-to-end process for evaluating acquisition/investment/business opportunities, from initial research through financial model and pitch deck. Gitignored (private financial analysis).

## 2026-03-10 — Fix date logic bugs in standup preprocessing scripts

### Fixed
- **`networking_followup.py` — column mismatch bug:** Script read `cols[5]` as "Follow-Up Action" but the real Contacts table has 7 columns (`Name | Company | Role | Relationship | Added | Last Interaction | Email`) where `cols[5]` is Last Interaction (a date). This caused every contact's last interaction date to be parsed as a follow-up note — `infer_followup_date()` found a YYYY-MM-DD pattern and treated it as the due date, making contacts appear "overdue" the day after any interaction. **Symptom:** Marisa Patel-O'Connor showed "1 day overdue" on 2026-03-10 despite being emailed 2026-03-09 with a follow-up target of ~2026-03-16.
- **`networking_followup.py` — wrong data source:** Follow-up information lives in the Interaction Log section (`**Follow-up:**` lines under `### Name — Company`), not in the Contacts table. The script now reads follow-ups from the Interaction Log and uses the entry's `#### YYYY-MM-DD` date for relative inference (e.g., "next week" = entry_date + 7d). Contacts with no interaction log, `—` follow-ups, or "None required" follow-ups are skipped.
- **`outreach_pending.py` — no cross-reference for replies:** Script only read `outreach-log.md`. When a reply was logged via `networking_write.py log`, the outreach entry still showed "Sent" because the two data files were independent. Now cross-references `networking.md` Interaction Log: if a contact has an interaction dated *after* their outreach, the outreach is treated as "Replied". **Symptom:** Farr Hariri still showed "awaiting response" after his reply was logged.

### Added
- **`networking_write.py` — auto-update outreach-log.md on reply detection:** When `log` is called and the summary contains reply-signal keywords (replied, responded, call scheduled, meeting set, etc.), the most recent "Sent" entry for that contact in `outreach-log.md` is updated to "Replied". This is write-path reconciliation complementing the read-path cross-reference in `outreach_pending.py`.
- **4 new tests in `test_networking_followup.py`:** `test_most_recent_followup_used`, `test_none_required_followup_skipped`, `test_marisa_bug_regression`, `test_dash_followup_skipped`
- **3 new tests in `test_outreach_pending.py`:** `test_cross_reference_networking_reply`, `test_cross_reference_no_later_interaction`, `test_cross_reference_no_networking_file`

### Changed
- **`test_networking_followup.py` rewritten:** All fixtures updated from the incorrect 6-column format (`Name | Company | Role | Relationship | Last Interaction | Follow-Up Action`) to the real 7-column format + Interaction Log sections. 6 tests → 9 tests.
- **Test count:** 165 → 176 (11 net new tests)

### Root Cause
Two scripts (`networking_followup.py` and `outreach_pending.py`) and the data model (`networking.md` Contacts table vs Interaction Log) drifted out of sync. The Contacts table schema changed when `networking_write.py` was built (Added + Email columns replaced Follow-Up Action), but the read scripts were never updated. The outreach-log.md ↔ networking.md data silo existed from inception — both were designed as independent stores with no cross-referencing.

## 2026-03-09 — Context trimming + memory hygiene

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — trimmed from 396 → 196 lines (51% reduction, ~5,350 tokens saved per conversation):
  - Repository structure tree collapsed from 112 lines to 15 (top-level with brief descriptions)
  - "Working With This Repo" section (50 lines of user-facing docs) removed — `docs/usage.md` covers this
  - Answering Strategies expanded list collapsed to one sentence
  - Output file examples reduced from 7 to 3
  - Tools section condensed — kept gotchas and atomic write scripts, dropped per-script descriptions
- **`memory/MEMORY.md`** — trimmed from 157 → 66 lines (57% reduction, ~1,375 tokens saved per conversation). Archived resolved sections to `memory/archive-2026-03.md`.
- **`README.md`** — fixed "23 skills" → "27 skills" in architecture description; updated `tools/` description from "PDF conversion utilities" to "Python scripts: PDF, preprocessing, atomic writes, n8n automation"
- **`docs/methodology.md`** — added 5 missing preprocessing scripts to tools tree (`todo_daily_metrics.py`, `pipeline_staleness.py`, `outreach_pending.py`, `networking_followup.py`, `dossier_freshness.py`); added `memory/` directory to architecture tree; updated test count 137 → 165

### Added
- **`CLAUDE.md` "Memory Hygiene" section** — rules for when to archive vs keep entries in MEMORY.md (archive when: codebase is source of truth, leads resolved, features stable >2 weeks, reminders past date)
- **`memory/archive-2026-03.md`** — archived resolved sections: completed skill additions, output hierarchy migration, skills audit fixes, CV quality check sync, skill updates, Amae Health research briefs, stale outreach notes, resolved search leads (Notion rejected, Odyssey dead)

### Removed (from MEMORY.md)
- n8n API key (security concern — should not be stored in auto-loaded memory)
- Stale "NEW" labels on established skills
- Completed migration notes (output hierarchy, skills audit fixes)
- Resolved lead context (Notion, Odyssey PBC)

### Notes
- Combined token savings: ~6,725 tokens per conversation (~$0.10-0.20 saved per session at Opus rates)
- All information removed from CLAUDE.md either exists in `docs/usage.md` (user guide), is discoverable via Glob (file structure), or was redundant with section content that follows the tree
- Methodology test count updated from 137 (Phase 2 baseline) to 165 (current)

## 2026-03-04 — Extract application workflow framework

### Added
- **`framework/application-workflow.md`** — single source of truth for shared application standards. Contains 6 sections: Candidate Context Loading (with per-output-type table), Company Dossier Staleness Check, Tailoring Rules (incl. Keyword Pragmatism), CV Quality Standards (5 subsections), 16-point CV Quality Checks, and Cheat Sheet Structure (contents, quality rules, markdown template).

### Changed
- **`/generate-cv`** — replaced ~165 lines of inline rules with references to `framework/application-workflow.md`. Deleted Tailoring Rules section, CV Quality Standards section, Cheat Sheet Format template, and the "Future: Application Workflow Framework" TODO.
- **`/apply`** — replaced ~65 lines of inline rules with framework references. **Fixed two bugs:** (1) broken reference to `framework/style-guidelines.md` for Tailoring Rules/Quality Standards (that file doesn't contain those rules), now correctly points to `framework/application-workflow.md`; (2) candidate context loading was missing `data/goals.md` in the numbered list (now uses framework superset).
- **`/cover-letter`** — replaced candidate context loading and dossier staleness check with framework references (~15 lines saved). Cover letter quality gates remain inline (unique to this skill).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added `application-workflow.md` to framework/ listing; updated Resume Generation section description.

### Notes
- `/review-cv` and `/review-cv-deep` intentionally NOT modified — they operate from a reviewer perspective and don't share the same generation rules.
- This extraction was triggered by the TODO in generate-cv (line 349): "if the same rule needs to be updated in more than one skill at the same time" — which happened twice in the 2026-03-04 session (quality checks 9-16 sync and cover letter format sync).

---

## 2026-03-04 — Cover letter rewrite + /apply quality sync

### Changed
- **`/cover-letter` skill rewritten** — replaced generic 3-paragraph hook/value/close with research-backed **Problem-Solution format** (4 sections: Hook → Proof → Bridge → Close). Based on meta-analysis of 80+ cover letter studies showing Problem-Solution outperforms traditional formats. Key changes: leads with company's specific challenge, uniqueness test quality gate, resume separation test, ATS keyword weaving (3-5 terms), 250-350 word target.
- **`/apply` Step 7 updated** — cover letter section now uses the same Problem-Solution format as standalone `/cover-letter` skill.
- **`/apply` Step 6b synced with `/generate-cv`** — added quality checks 9-16 that were missing: date math validation, month-level dates for short/recent tenures, causal attribution check, skills evidence check, metric specificity, client engagement disambiguation, role progression in titles, jargon translation.

### Notes
- Cover letter research sources: Interview Guys meta-analysis (80+ studies), HBR 2025, Ask a Manager, Jobscan, Resume Genius (625 managers), MyPerfectResume (1,000+ seekers). Key stat: 94% of hiring managers say cover letters influence interview decisions; 90% of generic letters rejected.
- Both `/cover-letter` and `/apply` now enforce the same Problem-Solution structure and quality gates.

## 2026-03-01 — n8n background automation (4 workflows)

### Added
- **4 n8n workflows** built and active at http://localhost:5678 (`n8n start` via `tools/run_n8n.bat`):
  - **Gmail Fetch** (every 15 min) — runs `gmail_fetch.py --label-id Label_7175134973725917628`; replaces Windows Task Scheduler task
  - **Standup Cache Warm** (weekdays 8am) — runs `act_classify.py` + `pipeline_staleness.py` in parallel; writes pre-computed JSON to `tools/.cache/`
  - **Follow-up Nudge + Dossier Freshness** (daily 9am) — runs `n8n_outreach_nudge.py` + `n8n_dossier_nudge.py` in parallel; writes inbox items when overdue follow-ups or stale dossiers are found
  - **Weekly Review Reminder** (Friday 4pm) — runs `n8n_weekly_reminder.py`; writes `inbox/YYYYMMDD-weekly-review-reminder.md`
- **`tools/n8n_outreach_nudge.py`** — delegates to `outreach_pending.py`; writes inbox nudge if `awaiting_response_overdue` is non-empty
- **`tools/n8n_dossier_nudge.py`** — delegates to `dossier_freshness.py`; writes inbox nudge if `staleness_alerts` is non-empty
- **`tools/n8n_weekly_reminder.py`** — writes weekly review reminder to `inbox/`
- **`tools/run_n8n.bat`** — n8n startup script; sets `NODES_EXCLUDE=[]` to re-enable the Execute Command node (blocked by default in n8n 2.x); always use instead of bare `n8n start`
- **`tools/.cache/`** — pre-computed JSON cache directory written by Standup Cache Warm workflow

### Changed
- **Windows Task Scheduler** — "Gmail Fetch (Job Search)" task disabled; n8n workflow handles the same 15-min cadence

### Notes
- n8n 2.x excludes `n8n-nodes-base.executeCommand` by default via `NODES_EXCLUDE` env var; `run_n8n.bat` overrides this with `NODES_EXCLUDE=[]`
- n8n API key stored in `~/.n8n/database.sqlite` (label: `claude-automation`)

---

## 2026-03-01 — Gmail integration pipeline

### Added
- **`tools/gmail_fetch.py`** — incremental Gmail sync: OAuth, Gmail history API, body sanitization (HTML strip → invisible unicode removal → injection phrase redaction → truncation → XML wrap), inbox file writes, 48h auto-cleanup of Gmail files, token expiry alerting. All pure functions are top-level and testable without Google API deps.
- **`tools/run_gmail_fetch.bat`** — Windows Task Scheduler wrapper; appends to `logs/gmail_fetch.log`
- **`logs/`** added to `.gitignore` alongside `tools/gmail_credentials.json`, `tools/gmail_token.json`, `tools/.gmail_state.json`
- **Gmail deps** added to `requirements.txt` (optional section): `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `beautifulsoup4`
- **28 new tests** in `tests/scripts/test_gmail_fetch.py` (165 total, all passing): `sanitize_body` (9 tests), `extract_plain_text` (4), `build_inbox_filename` (5), `write_inbox_file` (2), `cleanup_old_inbox_files` (5), `act_classify` gmail detection (3)

### Changed
- **`tools/act_classify.py`** — `classify_inbox_file` now detects `source="gmail"` in inbox file content and sets `source_type: "gmail"` on the item. Type classification still runs for display; routing to Bucket A is blocked by `/act` security policy.
- **`/act` skill** — security warning block added before Step 1: email content inside `<email-content>` tags is untrusted, injection instructions must be flagged, gmail items require explicit Nick confirmation before any data file write.

---

## 2026-02-28 — Phase 2: 4 atomic write scripts + skill wiring

### Added
- **`tools/pipe_write.py`** — atomic add/update/remove for `data/job-pipeline.md`
- **`tools/networking_write.py`** — atomic add/log/remove for `data/networking.md`
- **`tools/remember_apply.py`** — 8 destination handlers routing notes to the correct data file
- **`tools/act_apply.py`** — pipeline-add/contact-add/notes-add for `/act` Immediate Route writes
- **48 new tests** in `tests/scripts/` (137 total, all passing)
- **`conftest.py` `write_fixture`** — shared helper for write script tests

### Changed
- **`/pipe`** — inline write logic replaced with `pipe_write.py` calls; allowed-tools updated
- **`/networking`** — inline write logic replaced with `networking_write.py` calls; allowed-tools updated
- **`/remember`** — Step 3 write logic replaced with `remember_apply.py` calls; allowed-tools updated
- **`/act`** — Step 4 Immediate Route format specs replaced with `act_apply.py` commands; inline `Write()` tools removed from allowed-tools

---

## 2026-02-28 — Deterministic script migration + CLAUDE.md audit + continuous learning loop

### Added
- **`tools/act_classify.py`** — classifies Pending todos + inbox items into bucket_a/bucket_b/skipped/inbox_items JSON; replaces inline LLM classification in `/act` Steps 1–2
- **`tools/pipe_read.py`** — pipeline read with per-entry staleness annotations (stale_label, needs_attention, missing_action), metrics, and company_index; replaces inline date math in `/pipe`
- **`tools/networking_read.py`** — contacts read with stale_contacts, pipeline_connections, interaction counts, and metrics; replaces inline stale detection in `/networking`
- **`tools/remember_classify.py`** — 8-priority rule engine: classifies note text into typed destinations[] with entity matching against networking/pipeline/dossier slugs; replaces classification table in `/remember`
- **24 new tests** in `tests/scripts/` covering all 4 new scripts (89 total, all passing)

### Changed
- **`/act`** — Steps 1–2 (75 lines of inline classification tables) replaced with `act_classify.py` call + JSON parse
- **`/pipe`** — Show command inline staleness math replaced with `pipe_read.py` JSON fields
- **`/networking`** — Show command inline stale detection + pipeline scan replaced with `networking_read.py`; `Edit(data/networking.md)` removed from allowed-tools
- **`/remember`** — Step 1 classification table replaced with `remember_classify.py` call
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — skill count corrected (20→27); LEGACY dirs removed from tree (deleted 2026-02-25); `/standup` + `/checkout` added to Ongoing Tracking; `/apply` added to Applications; all 9 preprocessing scripts listed in tools section
- **`memory/lessons.md`** — Section 2 back-populated with 8 Nick's Voice patterns (all Promoted=Yes); closes the email correction loop
- **`docs/self-improving-data-framework.md`** — stale Note Routing and Longitudinal Logging entries updated to reflect `remember_classify.py`, `act_classify.py`, and `/checkout`
- **`docs/methodology.md`** — `/todo daily` replaced with `/checkout` in Daily Operations section

---

## 2026-02-28 — /critique-plan skill, /scan-contacts skill, todo_write.py, PDF + style fixes

### Added
- **`/critique-plan` skill** — six-agent plan critique + hybrid plan synthesis. Inserts a structured review step between Codex plan generation and Claude execution. Five analytical agents (completeness, risk/safety, codebase alignment, simplicity/scope, sequencing) run in parallel against the Codex plan; a sixth independent Claude planner receives only the stated goal (no Codex steps — no anchoring) to generate a clean-room plan. Synthesizes a diff table (Codex vs Claude) and an enhanced hybrid plan with all blockers resolved, gaps filled, and order corrected. Inline output only — no file written. Agents 1/2/3/6 use sonnet; agents 4/5 use haiku.
- **`/scan-contacts` skill** — LinkedIn contact scanner for a target company. Runs `tools/linkedin-scanner/scan.py` to fetch profiles, then ranks each contact on four dimensions: role proximity (hiring decision authority), education overlap, network connectedness, and industry fit. Outputs a ranked table and adds top contacts to `data/networking.md`.
- **`tools/todo_write.py`** — atomic mutation tool for `data/job-todos.md`. Handles `add`, `done`, `clear`, and `sync` without loading the full file into Claude's context. Outputs JSON. The `sync` command fast-paths out immediately if the pipeline Archived section is empty.

### Changed
- **`/todo` skill** — all mutation commands (add, done, clear, sync) now delegate to `tools/todo_write.py` via Bash. Direct file manipulation removed. Pipeline sync step rewritten to call `todo_write.py sync` instead of reading and rewriting the file manually.
- **`tools/md_to_pdf.py`** — major rewrite for 1-page CV output: switched from Helvetica to Calibri (registered via ReportLab TTFont from `C:/Windows/Fonts/`), tightened page margins (8mm/13mm), reduced line-height to 1.1, reduced body font-size to 8.5pt, tightened section spacing throughout.
- **`framework/style-guidelines.md`** — added Nick's CV formatting preferences: no em dashes or en dashes (use hyphens everywhere), comma separators for skills lists (not dots or bullets).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added `todo_write.py` to repo structure listing; updated Write-Only Files section to specify that mutations must use `todo_write.py`; added `todo_write.py` usage examples to Tools & Environment section.
- **`.claude/settings.local.json`** — added pre-approved WebFetch domains (luma.com, oceantechhackathon.org, sofarocean.com, propellervc.com, aquatic-labs.com) and pre-approved Bash patterns (`git add:*`, `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python:*`).

### Tests added
- `tests/scripts/test_linkedin_scanner_parser.py` — unit tests for LinkedIn profile parser
- `tests/scripts/test_linkedin_scanner_scan.py` — integration tests for scan workflow
- `tests/scripts/test_linkedin_scanner_unit.py` — unit tests for scanner core
- `tests/skills/SCAN_CONTACTS_TESTING.md` — manual testing guide for `/scan-contacts`

### Files changed
- `.claude/skills/critique-plan/SKILL.md` — new
- `.claude/skills/scan-contacts/SKILL.md` — new
- `tools/todo_write.py` — new
- `tests/scripts/test_linkedin_scanner_parser.py`, `test_linkedin_scanner_scan.py`, `test_linkedin_scanner_unit.py` — new
- `tests/skills/SCAN_CONTACTS_TESTING.md` — new
- `.claude/skills/todo/SKILL.md` — mutation commands rewired to todo_write.py
- `tools/md_to_pdf.py` — major rewrite (Calibri, tight spacing)
- `framework/style-guidelines.md` — Nick's CV formatting preferences added
- `CLAUDE.md` — todo_write.py docs added; Write-Only Files section updated
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — domain + bash permissions added

## 2026-02-26 — Edit tool safety: Write-only enforcement + PostToolUse hook

### Root cause
The Edit tool silently fails (returns success, no change) when `old_string` spans lines >~500 characters in markdown table files. No external linter is involved — this is intrinsic Edit tool behavior. Affected files: `data/job-todos.md` (543 chars max), `data/job-pipeline.md` (524 chars max), all `output/**/*.md` dossiers (up to 1,677 chars).

### Changed
- **7 skill `allowed-tools` fixes** — removed `Edit()` on risky files, keeping only `Write()`:
  - `todo/SKILL.md` — removed `Edit(data/job-todos.md)`
  - `pipe/SKILL.md` — removed `Edit(data/job-pipeline.md)`
  - `apply/SKILL.md` — removed `Edit(data/job-pipeline.md)`
  - `cover-letter/SKILL.md` — removed `Edit(data/job-pipeline.md)`
  - `generate-cv/SKILL.md` — removed `Edit(data/job-pipeline.md)`, `Edit(output/**)`
  - `remember/SKILL.md` — removed `Edit(data/job-pipeline.md)`, `Edit(output/**)`
  - `act/SKILL.md` — removed `Edit(data/job-todos.md)`, `Edit(data/job-pipeline.md)`, `Edit(output/**)`

### Added
- **`tools/check_edit_safety.py`** — PostToolUse hook script; warns when Edit is used on markdown files with rows >500 chars; hard-stops on known write-only files (`job-todos.md`, `job-pipeline.md`)
- **`.claude/settings.json`** — PostToolUse hook registration; triggers `check_edit_safety.py` after every Edit call on `.md` files

### Documented
- **`CLAUDE.md` Write-Only Files section** — lists the two affected data files and all output dossiers; explains the root cause; points to the hook

### Files changed
- `.claude/skills/todo/SKILL.md`, `pipe/SKILL.md`, `apply/SKILL.md`, `cover-letter/SKILL.md`, `generate-cv/SKILL.md`, `remember/SKILL.md`, `act/SKILL.md` — allowed-tools updated
- `tools/check_edit_safety.py` — new
- `.claude/settings.json` — new
- `CLAUDE.md` — Write-Only Files section added

---

## 2026-02-26 — /checkout + /apply skills, preprocessing scripts, token optimization

### Added
- **`/checkout` skill** — end-of-day close-out, bookend to `/standup`. Absorbs `/todo daily` entirely. Runs `todo_daily_metrics.py` to build today's snapshot, writes daily log entry, calculates streak/velocity, surfaces tomorrow's top 3 cross-referenced against the weekly review's Top 5 priorities.
- **`/apply` skill** — one-command apply bundle: fetches JD, runs CV generation logic, runs cover letter logic, and adds/updates the pipeline entry. Eliminates the 3-command apply flow.
- **5 preprocessing scripts** in `tools/` — each accepts `--target-date` and `--repo-root`, outputs JSON to stdout:
  - `todo_daily_metrics.py` — todos, daily log, pipeline snapshot, outreach, research, changelog (~2,300 tokens saved per `/checkout` run)
  - `pipeline_staleness.py` — per-stage staleness thresholds (Researching=7d, Applied=5d, Screening=5d, Interview=7d, Offer=3d)
  - `dossier_freshness.py` — detects dossiers by filename==parent pattern, classifies by freshness
  - `outreach_pending.py` — awaiting/overdue outreach, response rate calculation
  - `networking_followup.py` — infers follow-up due dates from free-text (next week, 3–5 biz days, explicit dates, default 14d)
- **28 pytest tests** in `tests/scripts/` — full coverage of all 5 scripts; `conftest.py` sets `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` for Windows compatibility

### Changed
- **`/standup`** — Step 1 now runs `pipeline_staleness.py`, `outreach_pending.py`, `networking_followup.py` instead of reading 6 files and parsing manually; `allowed-tools` simplified to `Read(*)`
- **`/weekly-review`** — Steps 2/3/5 now use script JSON instead of manual file parsing; Step 1 calls 3 scripts + reads only 2 files; velocity (Step 4) reads from daily log (not raw todos); edge case note updated from `/todo daily` to `/checkout`
- **`/scan-jobs`** — Step 7b added: after scoring, surfaces shortlisted roles (≥80%) not already in pipeline and prompts to add them
- **`/todo`** — `daily` command removed; replaced with one-line redirect to `/checkout`
- **`prep-interview`, `generate-cv`, `cold-outreach`, `follow-up`** — inline stale dossier warning (>30 days old) with refresh suggestion; never blocks execution

### Files changed
- `.claude/skills/checkout/SKILL.md` — new
- `.claude/skills/apply/SKILL.md` — new
- `tools/todo_daily_metrics.py`, `pipeline_staleness.py`, `dossier_freshness.py`, `outreach_pending.py`, `networking_followup.py` — new
- `tests/scripts/conftest.py` + 5 test files — new
- `tests/skills/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` — new
- `.claude/skills/standup/SKILL.md` — Step 1 rewritten, Step 2 analysis sections replaced with JSON refs
- `.claude/skills/weekly-review/SKILL.md` — Steps 1/2/3/5 rewritten; allowed-tools updated
- `.claude/skills/scan-jobs/SKILL.md` — Step 7b added
- `.claude/skills/todo/SKILL.md` — daily command removed
- `.claude/skills/prep-interview/SKILL.md`, `generate-cv/SKILL.md`, `cold-outreach/SKILL.md`, `follow-up/SKILL.md` — stale dossier warning added

---

## 2026-02-25 — Response tracking + lessons loop auto-promotion

### Added
- **Response tracking in `/follow-up`** — Step 1b inserted between Step 1 and Step 2 in Named Contact Mode. Before drafting, `/follow-up` now scans `data/outreach-log.md` for Drafted/Sent rows for this contact, asks "Did they reply?", and updates the Status column to `Replied` or `No reply`. The reply status flows into Step 3 to ensure the correct follow-up type is selected (e.g., a Nudge can't be chosen if they already replied).
- **Lessons loop auto-promotion in all outreach skills** — Step 0 added to `/cold-outreach`, `/follow-up`, and `/draft-email`. Before drafting, each skill scans `memory/lessons.md` Section 2 for patterns with Occurrences ≥ 2 AND Promoted = No, then prompts the user to promote them to `framework/style-guidelines.md`. Prevents Nick's Voice rules from stagnating in lessons.md indefinitely.
- **Outreach reply routing in `/remember`** — New classification type: "Outreach reply" detected when a note mentions a person's name alongside reply-indicating words ("replied", "got back to me", "heard back from", etc.). Routes to `data/outreach-log.md` — updates the most recent Drafted/Sent row to `Replied`. Falls back to networking.md if no matching row found. Reply notes that also contain contact info write to both files.

### Files changed
- `.claude/skills/follow-up/SKILL.md` — added Step 1b (reply status check) + Step 3 reply_status routing note
- `.claude/skills/cold-outreach/SKILL.md` — added Step 0 (lessons promotion check)
- `.claude/skills/draft-email/SKILL.md` — added Step 0 (lessons promotion check)
- `.claude/skills/remember/SKILL.md` — added Outreach reply classification + Step 3 handler + two new examples

## 2026-02-25 — Self-improvement loop repairs + email tone clarity

### Bugs fixed
- **`memory/lessons.md` didn't exist** — the self-improvement loop defined in `CLAUDE.md` wrote corrections to this file, but it was never created. Any email/outreach edits since the loop was added had nowhere to land. File created with the correct two-section table structure (Section 1: general corrections; Section 2: email/outreach corrections with Occurrences + Promoted tracking).
- **`/draft-email` silently ignored Nick's Voice** — `/cold-outreach` and `/follow-up` both loaded `framework/style-guidelines.md` for Nick's voice patterns, but `/draft-email` Step 3 only loaded `outreach-guide.md`. Thank-you notes, status updates, and intro requests were drafted without the learned phrasing rules. Added `framework/style-guidelines.md` to `/draft-email` context loading.

### Improved
- **Disambiguation between the two tone sources** — both `framework/outreach-guide.md` and `framework/style-guidelines.md` contained tone guidance with no stated relationship. Added scope notes to each:
  - `outreach-guide.md` Tone Matching Protocol: marks it as HOW to calibrate tone from prior messages; directs agents to style-guidelines for WHAT Nick sounds like.
  - `style-guidelines.md` Nick's Voice: marked as the canonical source, precedence over outreach-guide when they conflict, fed by the lessons loop from `memory/lessons.md`.

### Files changed
- `memory/lessons.md` — created
- `.claude/skills/draft-email/SKILL.md` — added `framework/style-guidelines.md` to Step 3
- `framework/style-guidelines.md` — disambiguation header on Nick's Voice section
- `framework/outreach-guide.md` — scope note on Tone Matching Protocol

## 2026-02-25 — Nick's Voice guidelines + outreach skill wiring

- Added "Nick's Voice — Outreach & Email" section to `framework/style-guidelines.md` with specific greetings, closings, phrasing patterns, and sentence-level rules derived from actual sent messages
- Wired Nick's Voice into `/cold-outreach` and `/follow-up` skills

---

## 2026-02-25 — Company notes convention

- Added `data/company-notes/<slug>.md` as the standard location for personal company context (recruiter calls, video notes, call prep, observations)
- Wired into all generative skills: `/generate-cv`, `/cover-letter`, `/prep-interview`, `/cold-outreach`
- Added convention to `/remember` and `/act` so new observations are routed there automatically

---

## 2026-02-25 — Self-improvement loop

- Added Self-Improvement Loop section to `CLAUDE.md`: after any correction, open `memory/lessons.md`, add/update a row, promote to `framework/style-guidelines.md` when pattern hits 2+ occurrences

---

## 2026-02-25 — Output hierarchy migration

- Adopted company-first output structure: every named entity gets `output/<slug>/` subfolder
- Dossier file: `output/<slug>/<slug>.md` (no date prefix — canonical, in-place versioned)
- All other artifacts inside the folder use `MMDDYY` date prefix
- Updated `/generate-cv`, `/cover-letter`, `/prep-interview`, `/cold-outreach`, `/follow-up`, `/draft-email`, `/research-industry`
- Removed legacy `data/company-research/` and `data/industry-research/` references from all skills

---

## 2026-02-25 — Skill audit fixes (8 bugs)

- `allowed-tools` glob depth: switched from `*` to `**` for subdirectory writes across all output-writing skills
- `Edit(data/job-todos.md)` removed from 7 skills — linter reverts Edit changes on this file; only `Write` works
- Dossier read path standardized to `output/<slug>/<slug>.md` across all skills
- `/prep-interview` missing `Write(data/job-todos.md)` added
- `/import-cv` Step 5 had wrong command name (`/onboard` → `/import-cv`)

---

## 2026-02-24 — New skills: `/setup-goals`, `/cover-letter`

- `/setup-goals` — identity-aware goals bootstrapper; reads `professional-identity.md`, derives what it can, asks only the missing fields, writes `data/goals.md`
- `/cover-letter` — 3-paragraph cover letter (hook → value bridge → close with ask); saves to `output/<company-slug>/MMDDYY-cover-letter.md`, syncs pipeline
- `framework/templates/goals.md` slimmed: removed Priority Stack, Industries, Non-Negotiables (those live in `professional-identity.md`)

---

## 2026-02-24 — Profile guard

- Added hard prerequisite check before all generative and research skills: both `data/profile.md` and `data/goals.md` must exist and contain real content before proceeding
- Skills affected: `/generate-cv`, `/research-company`, `/research-industry`, `/prep-interview`, `/cold-outreach`, `/follow-up`, `/draft-email`, `/voice-export`, `/extract-identity`, `/review-cv`, `/review-cv-deep`, `/weekly-review`, `/scan-jobs`, `/standup`

---

## 2026-02-24 — Research quality standards

- Added Executive Summary + BLUF-per-section to all research dossiers
- Added evidence quality tiers (A/B/C), confidence tags, contradiction handling, and freshness rules
- Added Evidence Summary Table and contradiction audit as mandatory output sections in `/research-company` and `/research-industry`
- Added refresh behavior: if dossier exists and is fresh, offer "view existing" or "refresh"

---

## 2026-02-23 — `/standup` skill

- Morning briefing: reads goals/pipeline/todos/outreach/networking in parallel, outputs daily brief + one suggested action

---

## 2026-02-23 — Scope expansion

- Expanded `CLAUDE.md` from interview coach to full job search operating system
- Added pipeline tracking, outreach, networking, weekly reviews, and research workflows
- Added `/generate-cv`, `/prep-interview`, `/weekly-review` skills
