# Prep Interview — One-Command Interview Prep Package

Generates a comprehensive interview prep document for a scheduled or upcoming interview. Uses 3 parallel agents to map questions to coached answers, condense the company context, and build a tactics + logistics section. Produces a single output file and creates a follow-up debrief to-do.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS`:
  - **`<company>`** (required) — company name; matched against pipeline and company research dossier
  - **`[role]`** (optional) — role title if there are multiple pipeline entries for the same company
  - **`[context]`** (optional) — interview type (`recruiter`, `hiring-manager`, `panel`), date, or specific focus (e.g., `"hiring manager round, 2026-03-05"`, `"focus on operations experience"`)

Examples:
- `/prep-interview "Beacon"` — full prep for Beacon
- `/prep-interview "Acme AI" "Strategy & Operations"` — specify role
- `/prep-interview "Northwind" "hiring manager, 2026-03-10"` — with date and type
- `/prep-interview "Beacon" "Chief of Staff" "panel interview, focus on leadership"` — full args

If no company provided, display usage:
```
Usage: /prep-interview <company> [role] [context]

Examples:
  /prep-interview "Beacon"
  /prep-interview "Acme AI" "Strategy & Operations"
  /prep-interview "Northwind" "hiring manager, 2026-03-10"
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse Arguments and Look Up Pipeline

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into company name, optional role, optional context string.
2. **Infer interview type** from context string:
   - Contains "recruiter" or "phone screen" or "screening" → `recruiter`
   - Contains "hiring manager" or "HM" → `hiring-manager`
   - Contains "panel" or "loop" → `panel`
   - Otherwise → `general` (default)
3. **Extract interview date** if present in context (look for YYYY-MM-DD or natural date like "March 10").
4. Read `data/job-pipeline.md`. Search for the company name (case-insensitive, fuzzy — company name as substring). If multiple roles for the same company, and a role was specified, match on that. If still ambiguous, use the most recently updated entry.
5. From the matching pipeline entry, note: **stage**, **role**, **CV Used** (output filename), **URL**, **notes**.
6. Generate a slug from the company name (lowercase, hyphens).

### Step 1b: Pre-Flight Gates (interview-prep-discipline.md)

Set these before loading context; they gate which sections the prep produces. Canon: `framework/interview-prep-discipline.md`.

1. **Comp pre-flight (E1/E2).** Is compensation on THIS call's agenda? Default **No** for `recruiter`, `hiring-manager`, `panel`, and `general` screens unless the context string says "comp", "offer", or "salary", or the pipeline stage is offer. If **No**: produce NO comp script, floor, walk-away, or structure probe; if comp surfaces live, the one-line deferral is "comp lives at offer stage for me; happy to use this time on the seat itself." If **Yes** (comp-agenda call or offer stage): Agent 2 includes a comp-structure question set (base/bonus/equity/vesting; for startups, percent ownership + 409A + cliff), and do not volunteer Nick's floor when their quote sits above it.
2. **Round-type branch.** If the context signals a detail/PEI-style round (deep behavioral drilling, "go deep on one story", McKinsey-style) set `pei-round = true` (drives Agent 1 PEI Deep-N and the Drill Plan in Step 4d). If the call is a discovery / first-call / recruiter screen set `discovery = true` (drives the "What I'm Testing About Me" block in Step 4e).
3. **Audience-fluency (C1).** If the interviewer's professional background is known (company-notes, pipeline, or research, e.g. ex-MBB/consulting), flag their fluency and pass it to Agent 2. MBB/consulting-fluent means the prep deploys structure AND updates it (never "drop the consulting voice"); operator/founder without that background keeps the "don't perform structure" guidance.

### Step 2: Load Context (parallel)

Read the following in parallel — skip any that don't exist:

1. Company dossier — `output/<slug>/<slug>.md`

   **Staleness check:** After reading, grep for `Last updated:` in the first 10 lines of the dossier. Parse the date. If the dossier is more than 30 days old (or if no `Last updated:` line is found), display this inline warning — then continue, never block:
   > ⚠️ Company dossier is [N] days old (last updated YYYY-MM-DD). Consider refreshing: `/research-company "[Company]"`
2. Company notes — `data/company-notes/<slug>.md` — personal notes, call context, recruiter observations
2b. Interviewer dossier — `data/people/<slug>.md` (if the interviewer is known; slug = interviewer name lowercased, accents folded, spaces→hyphens) — synthesized relationship context (what they care about, pressure points, prior touchpoints, what Nick owes them). Feeds the audience-fluency read (Step 1b C1) and the Agent 3 Live-Need Bridge block. Example: `data/people/jane-doe.md`.
3. `data/profile.md`
4. `data/professional-identity.md`
5. `coaching/coached-answers.md`
6. `coaching/anti-pattern-tracker.md`
7. `coaching/pressure-points.md`
8. `framework/answering-strategies/anti-patterns.md`
8b. `framework/answering-strategies/bridge-to-stated-need.md` — the live-need bridge strategy (hypothesis H4). REQUIRED: used to generate the "Live-Need Bridge" block in the Agent 3 cheat sheet (predicted live-need sentence + in-call governor).
8c. `framework/interview-prep-discipline.md` — REQUIRED. The 13-discipline canon (Family V + Family II). Its CHECK lines drive the Step 1b pre-flight gates, the agent enhancements below, and the inline Self-Doubt / Drill Plan / Discovery sections (Steps 4c-4e). Load before dispatching agents.
9. If CV Used field is populated in pipeline: read `output/<cv-filename>` to get the exact projects and language used

Also Glob `data/projects/*.md` to have project files available for question mapping.

### Step 3: Web Research if No Company Dossier

If no company dossier was found (neither subfolder nor flat format):
- Run 2 searches in parallel via Exa MCP (`mcp__exa__web_search_exa`) as primary; fall back to WebSearch only if Exa returns nothing. Per the 2026-05-19 A/B verdict, Exa decisively outperforms web on primary-source reach for company/interview research.
  1. "[Company] recent news developments 2026" — recent developments
  2. "[Company] [role] interview process Glassdoor first-person" — interview-specific info (this query type is exactly the Glassdoor/paywalled class WebFetch tends to 403 on)
- Use the results to construct a minimal company context.
- Note prominently in the output: "⚠️ No dossier found for [Company] — prep is based on quick Exa search. For deeper prep, run `/research-company "[Company]"` first."

### Step 3b: Cross-Skill Consistency Check

Before launching agents, verify consistency between the data sources loaded in Steps 2-3. Check for and flag any contradictions:

1. **CV vs. research dossier:** If both a CV (from pipeline's "CV Used" field) and a company research dossier exist, verify:
   - The company description/framing in the CV aligns with the dossier's findings (e.g., CV doesn't describe the company as "Series A" if the dossier shows Series C)
   - The role framing in the CV matches what the dossier says the company is hiring for

2. **CV vs. coached answers:** If both exist, verify:
   - Experience claims are consistent (e.g., CV says "5 years React" but coached answer says "about 3 years with React")
   - Project descriptions don't contradict each other across the two files
   - The professional summary narrative aligns with coached pitch answers

3. **Coached answers vs. professional-identity.md:** If both exist, verify:
   - Strengths claimed in coached answers align with those in professional-identity.md
   - Career direction framing is consistent

If inconsistencies are found, include a **Consistency Warnings** section in the output file (after the At a Glance table) listing each discrepancy with:
- What conflicts (file A says X, file B says Y)
- Suggested resolution (which version to use in the interview, or flag for the user to decide)

Pass any found inconsistencies to Agent 1 (Question Mapping) so it can account for them in answer frameworks.

### Step 4: Launch 3 Parallel Agents

Use the Task tool to launch **3 parallel subagents** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, `model: "sonnet"`, `max_turns: 10`).

Pass to each agent:
- The company name, role, interview type, and interview date (if known)
- The candidate's key background points (from professional-identity.md and profile.md)
- The CV used (if available)
- The coached answers text (if available)
- The anti-pattern tracker text (if available)
- The company context (from dossier or web search results)
- Their specific focus and output format instructions below

#### Agent 1: Question Mapping

**Focus:** Likely interview questions → coached answers. Identify coverage gaps.

**Instructions:**
```
You are preparing [Candidate Name] for a [interview type] interview at [Company] for the [Role] position.

Your job: Map the most likely interview questions to existing coached answers, and flag gaps.

Context provided:
- Role requirements: [from JD/pipeline notes]
- Interview type: [recruiter/hiring-manager/panel/general]
- Company: [Company] — [brief context from dossier/search]
- Coached answers available: [coached-answers content]
- Projects/experience: [from CV if available, otherwise project summaries]

Step 1: Generate 10–12 likely questions for this specific role and interview type.
For a recruiter screen: focus on background, motivation, logistics, fit.
For a hiring manager: focus on behavioral STAR questions, strategic thinking, specific experience.
For a panel: mix of above plus role-specific technical/functional questions.
Tailor to [Company]'s stage/industry/culture signals from the context.

Step 2: For each question, check coached-answers.md and project experience for a good answer.
- If a strong coached answer exists: note the answer framework and key points to hit.
- If a partial match exists (related but not exact): note what to adapt.
- If no coached answer exists: flag as GAP.

Step 2b: For questions that draw on the candidate's personal experience or industry knowledge, ensure answer frameworks include HYPOTHESES about the company's challenges, not just observations of the problem space. "Observer thinking" (describing what you saw) is weaker than "operator thinking" (positing what the operational challenge actually is and what you'd investigate). This is especially important for S&O, operations, and strategy roles.

Step 2c (PEI Deep-N — B1): If this is a detail/PEI-style round, designate 2-3 "Deep-N" stories where the candidate OWNED the action with a QUANTIFIED, validated result. Pre-load each to four layers (Situation one line / granular first-person Action / quantified Result / Learning) and list 10+ second-order probes per story (decision rationale, others' reactions, the moment-level "what were you thinking", the trade-off, what you'd do differently). Demote any observed-not-owned or unquantified story to "frame/why-now", never a drill target (drilling it walks into an overclaim). Name THE single deepest story explicitly. Discipline line: "layer 3 of one, not layer 1 of three." Note the mid-2025 dimension relabel (Connection, Drive, Leadership, Growth); tag each Deep-N story to a dimension.

Step 2d (tag by job — F1): Tag every prep item carry/anchor (proves listening), screen (maps to goals.md, decides if Nick wants the seat), or answer (defends candidacy). Preserve any goals.md screen item even under compression.

Step 3: List the top 5 GAPS — questions where no good coached answer exists. These need new prep.

Output format:

## Likely Questions → Coached Answers

### Q1. [Question]
**Type:** [behavioral/motivational/situational/logistics]
**Answer framework:**
- [Key point 1 — cite specific project if relevant]
- [Key point 2]
- [Key point 3]
**Coached answer reference:** [Section in coached-answers.md, or "CONSTRUCT FROM: [project]"]
**Anti-patterns to avoid:** [1-2 relevant warnings]

### Q2. [Question]
...

## Answer Gaps (prep these before the interview)
| Question | Why it's a gap | Suggested approach |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| [Question] | No coached answer, no direct project | Use [gap-reframing strategy] |

## PEI Deep-N Designation (if pei-round)
[2-3 owned + quantified stories, each with 4 layers + 10+ probes; mark THE deepest and its dimension. List demoted (observed/unquantified) stories separately as frame-only.]

## Item Tags
[Each question/story tagged carry / screen / answer.]
```

#### Agent 2: Company Context Digest

**Focus:** Condense company research to what matters for THIS specific interview.

**Instructions:**
```
You are preparing [Candidate Name] for a [interview type] interview at [Company] for the [Role].

Your job: distill the company dossier (or web research) into only what matters for this interview.

Company context provided: [dossier or web search summary]
Interview type: [recruiter/hiring-manager/panel/general]
Candidate background: [brief summary from professional-identity.md]

Produce a tight, interview-ready company brief. NO fluff. Be specific and actionable.

Evidence weighting (F5 + F4): Weight evidence by source type. PR/keynote/brand content shows what they VALUE (frame as "they value X", never "they do X"); a call transcript or org-chart/calendar shows what they DO now, and the transcript overrides PR for the current job. Real values show in who a company hires, fires, promotes, and celebrates, not in perks or mission statements. For any intermediary intel (recruiter/referrer), weight by skin in the game: discount pure-commission recruiter pitch ~50%; treat an outgoing operator, advisor-equity holder, or long-relationship source as candid (downsides included).

## Company Context Digest

### Mission in 2 Sentences
[What [Company] does and why it matters — in plain language]

### Key Business Challenge Right Now
[The most important problem or opportunity the company is facing — what this team/role is hired to solve]

### Recent News to Reference
[1-3 specific, recent developments the candidate can mention to show they've done their homework. Include "I noticed that..." conversation starters.]

### What This Interviewer Probably Cares About
[2-3 things the hiring manager or recruiter at [Company] at this stage likely cares about most — based on role, stage, interview type, and company context]

### Cultural Signals
[2-3 specific cultural cues from the research — how the company talks about itself, what they value, any phrases or themes to mirror]

### Interviewer Fluency Read (C1)
[If the interviewer's background is known: MBB/consulting-fluent or operator/founder? If fluent, the prep deploys structure AND updates it (answer-first, MECE, then revise when data breaks it), do NOT drop structure. If not, keep "don't perform structure." State which applies.]

### Things to Avoid Mentioning
[Any sensitive topics, competitors to avoid comparing, assumptions to steer clear of]
```

---

#### Agent 3: Tactics & Logistics

**Focus:** Pre-call checklist, opening/closing strategy, questions to ask, logistics.

**Instructions:**
```
You are preparing [Candidate Name] for a [interview type] interview at [Company] for the [Role].

Your job: tactical preparation — how to handle the call, not just what to say.

Anti-patterns available: [anti-patterns.md content]
Anti-pattern tracker: [anti-pattern-tracker.md content — personal persistent patterns]
Company stage and interview type: [Company], [interview type], [stage from pipeline]

## Pre-Call Checklist (60-second scan before the call)

**Item 1 is fixed and MANDATORY — emit it verbatim as the first line of every generated checklist, above any tailored items:**

- [ ] **T-MINUS-2 SCAN, then the reset, then dial. Nothing substantive in between.** Re-read exactly three things in this doc: **THE ONE THING**, the **predicted live-need sentence**, and the **questions list**. Then run the filler reset aloud. Then dial. (~2 min total.)

[Then top 6-9 tailored checklist items — pulled from anti-patterns.md + personal anti-pattern tracker, specific to this interview type and company]
- [ ] [Item]
- [ ] [Item]

## Live-Need Bridge (REQUIRED — strategy: framework/answering-strategies/bridge-to-stated-need.md / hypothesis H4)

This is the highest-EV move and the #1 recurring miss. Produce all three:

**Predicted live-need sentence(s):** [1-2 sentences predicting how THIS interviewer will state what they need — a constraint they're under, a problem they're living, OR how they'll describe the role / what excites them. Ground in dossier + company-notes + interview type. e.g. founder: "we need X shipped before <event>"; hiring manager: "this person has to own <gap> from day one".]

**My match (specific, quantified):** [the 1-2 owned, quantified proofs from profile/projects that map onto the predicted need — NOT a value restatement. e.g. "call-center pilot: built the listening framework, drove $10M rollout".]

**In-call governor (read this line in the call):** *"When they name the live need (a constraint OR a role/value description that echoes me) → one specific bridge sentence + 'that's why I want this' → then stop. No default story. No generic affirm."*

## Frame-Import Guard (B2)
The bridge and any story draft use ONLY details Nick explicitly provided: his verbatim numbers, sequence, and words. Do NOT import settings, durations, or actions from the interviewer's vocabulary because they would "land well." The mirror to the interviewer happens at the observation level (a closing "sounds like the same shape as how you built it at X"), never inside Nick's own story. Test each line: could Nick say this cold, without the prep doc? If no, cut it.

## Polished-Arc Guard (B3)
Add this pre-call checklist item: "Count my clarifying questions before my first action verb; zero means the polished-arc reversion fired." The tell is a smooth problem-to-goal-to-action answer in under two minutes with no clarifying questions (it looks collaborative, so the "did a framework fire" check misses it). In case/behavioral drills, require 3+ self-generated clarifying questions before proposing any action.

## Bare Definitions Rehearsal (B4 — MANDATORY whenever Nick brings his own framework)

**Fires when** the round involves Nick presenting or defending a frame he authored: a take-home deck, a presentation defense, a case where he proposes criteria, a scorecard, a recommendation ranked along named dimensions. Skip only for pure behavioral rounds where Nick names no framework of his own.

**Produce a two-column table in the prep doc — every named term in Nick's frame, and its operational definition in UNDER EIGHT WORDS:**

| Term in my frame | What it IS, in <8 words |
|---|---|
| [criterion / metric / rung / threshold] | [the noun, not the reasoning] |

**Rules:**
- **If a term needs more than eight words, it is not a criterion yet.** It is a mood, and the interviewer will spend the block discovering that.
- Each definition must name **what is measured**, not why it matters. "Contained conversations plus CSAT" is a definition. "The outcome of those actions" is a rationale wearing a definition's clothes.
- Rehearse them **aloud, as bare definitions** — not as arguments. The live failure is answering *why* when asked *what*.
- Add the in-call governor to the checklist: *"Asked what something means → lead with the noun in under eight words, then stop. Rationale is the second sentence, only if they ask."*

**Orthogonality line (one sentence, also required):** name the pair of criteria most likely to be accused of overlap, and the one-sentence distinction. If an input appears under two criteria, that is a MECE defect and it must be resolved before the round, not defended in it. Full gate: `framework/adversarial-analysis-pipeline.md` §7.4.

**Origin:** an onsite at a target company. Eight turns to establish what "expected impact" meant, and the interviewer found a real MECE violation (CSAT load-bearing in criteria 1 and 3) that six days of review had never checked. Same defect fired in the other block on an integration primitive. See [[feedback_audit_frame_structure_not_only_claim_truth]] and the tracker's "Supplies a rationale when asked for a definition".

## Custody Rehearsal (B5 — presentation-defense rounds only)

**One rep, five minutes, before any round where Nick presents slides.** The counterpart halts him on the frame page and refuses to let him advance; he delivers the rest of the argument with no visual aid.

Every delivery rehearsal assumes the deck advances. **The likeliest real failure is being stopped on the page that carries the frame and never regaining the narrative** — in that room, slides 6 through 13 were never delivered as designed. Add to the checklist: *"If they take the floor at the frame page, I still owe them the argument. Know which three sentences carry it without the slides."*

## Reset-Carrier Rule (B6 — MANDATORY on every prep doc, no exceptions)

**The problem this solves:** a prep doc that is correct and never read is worth zero. On 2026-08-06 (founder screen, SMB-motion AI company) the doc was generated that morning, carried a same-day dossier refresh, and Nick did not open it. Consequence: **zero of six prepared questions asked**, the strongest unfakeable proof unused, the company's own role framing unused — and he led with five enterprise-scale signals at a small-business-motion company, which was the founder's stated reason for passing. The role mismatch was real; the doc had already corrected the frame that made it look bigger.

This is a **different and upstream** defect from the known read-but-not-retrieved failure (2026-07-22: the governor line was read back aloud and still did not fire live). Here the artifact never entered the loop, so every prep-doc-resident behavior-change clause — H4's live-need bridge and governor, B3's clarifying-question count, B4's bare definitions, the NN probe questions — silently did not run. **Any debrief of such a call will misattribute the resulting misses to skill rather than to non-consumption.**

**The rule: bind the doc to the reset, because the reset is the only pre-call ritual with a proven execution record.**

The filler reset runs reliably as the literal last action before dialing (confirmed 2026-08-06: full protocol compliance produced the corpus's best real-call filler density, 2.8%). The prep doc has no such carrier. So attach it to the one that works rather than hoping it gets read on its own:

**T-minus-2 → scan · T-minus-1 → reset · dial.** Nothing substantive in between.

The scan is exactly three things, and the prep doc must be structured so all three are findable in under two minutes:
1. **THE ONE THING** — the single framing sentence for this call.
2. **The predicted live-need sentence** + the one bridge proof (H4).
3. **The questions list.**

**Generation-side requirements (enforce when writing any prep doc):**
- The mandatory checklist item 1 above is emitted verbatim, before any tailored items.
- **THE ONE THING**, the Live-Need Bridge block, and the questions list must each be reachable without scrolling past a wall of context — put them in the first third of the doc, or repeat them in a scan block at the top.
- **Whose-customers line (REQUIRED, one sentence, inside THE ONE THING):** *"Their customers are ___, so the proof of mine shaped like their customer is ___."* Enterprise-scale proofs at a small-business-motion company read as mismatch even when the underlying skill transfers — and vice versa. This line is what was missing on 8/06.
- If a late addition or dossier refresh lands after the doc is written, **fold its consequences into THE ONE THING**, do not only append a section at the bottom. On 8/06 the 09:45 refresh was appended below a 215-line doc and was never reached.
- **Primary AND reserve proof (REQUIRED, two lines, inside THE ONE THING — no new section, no new heading).** Emit exactly this shape:

  ```
  **Primary proof** (domain: <canonical-tag>): <proof>
  **Reserve proof** (domain: <canonical-tag>): <proof>
  ```

  - Both tags come from `proof_domains.valid_tags()` — run `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 tools/proof_domains.py --list` to see them, or `--canonicalize <tag>` if the natural label is not in the enum. **Do not invent a tag**; pick the nearest canonical one.
  - **The two domains MUST differ after canonicalization.** `customer-experience` and `customer-ops` are the same domain wearing two labels — one exclusion sentence takes out both, which is exactly the failure this line exists to prevent. Step 6a's checker (check 3) blocks the PDF render if they collapse.
  - The reserve is not a second-favorite proof. It is the one to reach for when the interviewer rules the primary's whole domain out of scope mid-call.

  **Origin:** a prep doc pre-bound a single proof and said not to substitute it. Partway into the call the counterpart ruled that entire domain out of scope and called the proof's central deliverable commoditizable. There was no fallback, and the follow-up led with the dead proof anyway. `/follow-up` Step 3e now reads this reserve line when a transcript shows the primary was excluded.

**Debrief-side requirement:** `/debrief` must ask whether the prep doc was read before scoring any bridge or question-quality miss. A miss under non-consumption is logged against **prep artifact not consumed**, not against the skill it appears to be.

**Origin:** 2026-08-06 founder screen. See `coaching/anti-pattern-tracker.md` § "Prep artifact not consumed" and that date's file in `coaching/progress/`.

## Opening Strategy (first 60 seconds)
[How to open the call — tone, the one thing to establish immediately, what NOT to do in opening]
[Specific suggested opening line for a [interview type] call]

## Closing Strategy
[How to close the call — what to ask, what to confirm, how to leave a strong impression]
[Specific suggested closing move for [interview type] at [Company]]

## Questions to Ask — [Interview Type] at [Company]
[5–7 strong questions tailored to this interview type and company. For each: the question + one-line note on what it signals.]

For recruiter: focus on role clarity, team dynamics, next steps, timeline.
For hiring manager: focus on team priorities, success metrics, company direction, role impact.
For panel: mix — some technical/functional, some culture, some about the panel members' work.

1. [Question] — *signals: [what this shows]*
2. [Question] — *signals: [what this shows]*
...

## Format & Logistics Reminders
- Interview type: [recruiter/hiring manager/panel]
- Platform: [if known from context, otherwise "confirm platform before the call"]
- Duration: [if known, otherwise "typically N minutes for [type]"]
- Who you're talking to: [from pipeline notes or company research, if known]
- Dress: [appropriate level — video call defaults to business casual unless context suggests otherwise]
- Pre-call: [specific prep actions — review notes, test tech, etc.]
- Send-state of any artifact (CV, cover letter, deck): [ONLY from an `outreach_status.py --stamp` call made this run — see the mandatory gate below]
```

**Send-state claims in Logistics are gated (MANDATORY — do not paraphrase this away).**

Every claim about whether Nick already sent someone something comes from a stamp generated **this run**, with `--artifact` set to the artifact the claim is about:

```
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 tools/outreach_status.py \
  --recipient "<name>" --company "<company>" --artifact <cv|cover-letter|deck|portfolio|writeup|link> \
  --as-of <doc date YYYY-MM-DD> --stamp
```

Paste the returned `<!-- outreach_status: … -->` comment into the Logistics block. Then:

- **Never infer a send from the existence of a file under `output/`.** `output/` is a *draft archive*: a file there proves a draft was generated, not that it was attached, not that it was sent, and not that it arrived. This inference is the entire mechanism of the 2026-08-10 defect.
- `resolution: not_found` → render `[unverified: no outreach-log row for <name> as of <date>]`. Do not fill the gap from memory.
- `resolution: ambiguous` → render `[unverified: ambiguous recipient — candidates: …]`. The tool exits 2 and never guesses; neither do you.
- **Suppressive phrasing** ("do not re-offer it", "already sent", "no need to send") must **(a) name the artifact it suppresses** and **(b)** be backed by a stamp for *that same artifact* reading `delivered=true`.
  - `delivered=unknown` is **not** a license. The correct phrasing is *"sent <date>, no delivery confirmation — offer it again if asked."*
  - A recipient-level stamp (`artifact=none`) **never** licenses an artifact-level suppression. The recipient may have replied on an unrelated thread.
  - `delivered=false` means it bounced. Say so, and say to re-send.

**Step 6a runs `tools/check_prep_doc.py` against the saved doc and blocks the PDF render on failure** — checks 4-6 enforce (a) and (b) mechanically. This instruction is what makes the doc pass on the first try.

**Origin:** on 2026-08-10 a Logistics block asserted *"CV already sent 8/4, do not re-offer it."* No such row existed in the outreach log; the address had bounced on 8/4 (a fact recorded two lines above in the same block); the recipient asked for the CV again on 8/11. The suppressive half is the damaging half — it instructed Nick not to take the corrective action.

---

### Step 4b: Cross-Call Read-Forward (inline, not an agent)

After agents are dispatched, do these reads inline (in parallel with the agents). Output feeds three sections in the final document.

**1. Active anti-patterns** — read `coaching/progress/_summary.md` Anti-Pattern Scorecard. Take the top 3 by Total Occurrences (excluding zero-count rows). For each, look up its defense one-liner from `coaching/anti-pattern-tracker.md`.

**2. Promoted hypotheses for this format** — read `coaching/hypotheses.md`. Filter to Ladder = Promoted. For each, check whether the call's anticipated format tag appears in the hypothesis's Boundary clause. If yes, inject the Behavior-change clause directly. If no Promoted hypotheses exist, omit the section.

**3. Last session's predictions** — find the most recent `coaching/progress/<date>-*.md` (excluding `_summary.md`, the retrospective, and any drill files). Extract the `## Predictions for Next Session` block verbatim. Phrase as "From <date> <call> debrief: …" then prompt: "→ Has this work happened? Drill those answers before this call if not."

If any source is missing or empty, skip that section in output (graceful degradation per global CLAUDE.md rule).

### Step 4c: Expected Self-Doubt Firings (inline, mandatory; D1)

Per `framework/interview-prep-discipline.md` D1. REQUIRED in every prep doc (not agent-generated, since the belief catalog is Nick-specific). Read `data/professional-identity.md` for growth edges. Seed beliefs (use the ones that fit this call): not-smart-enough, don't-deserve-the-room, can't-ask-for-help, fraud, must-be-polished-before-sharing, disagree-pays-social-cost, too-generalist.

Build a table for 3-5 beliefs likely to fire in THIS call:

| Belief (verbatim) | Likely trigger in this call | Rehearsed counter-move (if-then) | Somatic signal |

Counter-moves must be if-then implementation intentions ("If the BCG-pedigree interviewer pushes twice, then I restate my position once before conceding"), not a vague "stay calm." Tie each belief to a professional-identity growth edge. Add one in-call reframe line: name the arousal as readiness, do not suppress it (suppression costs working memory).

### Step 4d: Drill Plan (inline, A1-A3; when pei-round OR 2+ gaps exist)

Per `framework/interview-prep-discipline.md` A1-A3 + B1. For the Deep-N stories (Agent 1) and the top gaps, produce a drill plan, not just "prep these":
- **Calibrate (A1):** for unfamiliar-domain content the drill is "read once, apply live", never "recall from memory." Name the drill type (recall / application / synthesis) and the baseline it assumes; a blank page means the design is wrong, not the candidate.
- **Cold spoken retrieval (A2):** each drill is a cold, aloud, timed, no-notes delivery before any review. For high-stakes calls add one rep under added pressure (cold-open or hostile follow-up).
- **Space + interleave (A3):** if there is more than one day, schedule spaced re-drills (next-day, +3 days) and interleave question types rather than block-repping one story.

Output each as: story/gap, drill type, one cold-delivery prompt, spacing note.

### Step 4e: What I'm Testing About Me (inline, F3; when discovery = true)

Per `framework/interview-prep-discipline.md` F3. Only for discovery / first-call / recruiter screens. Before the questions-to-ask-them list, write 2-3 of Nick's own-clarity probes: questions whose purpose is to test whether this seat energizes him when he describes it back, mapped to `data/goals.md` non-negotiables. Require that the reverse questions (Agent 3) each carry a behavioral anchor ("tell me about the last time...") rather than an abstract values question. Note inline: the post-call `/debrief` is mandatory for this rep to count.

---

### Step 5: Compile Output Document

After all 3 agents return, compile their outputs into a single document. Do not just concatenate — synthesize:
- Ensure question mapping (Agent 1) and company context (Agent 2) don't repeat the same facts
- Merge any overlapping anti-pattern warnings between Agent 1 and Agent 3 into one unified list
- Cross-link where relevant (e.g., if Agent 2 identified a key business challenge, and Agent 1 has a question about it, note the link)

**Staging gates:** If the interview type is `recruiter`, add explicit staging labels throughout:
- Mark any content that references personal experience, deeper disclosure, or operational insights with `[HM-STAGE ONLY]` or move to a separate "If You Advance" section at the bottom.
- Recruiter-stage answer frameworks should use the most guarded framing of personal motivation (e.g., "X is personal to me" not "going through X myself").
- For healthcare/behavioral health companies specifically: recruiters in the clinical space can infer program types from specific language. Heighten disclosure awareness in anti-patterns.

**Self-reported metrics:** When citing company-reported outcomes (readmission rates, NPS, adherence, cost savings) in answer frameworks or company context, qualify with "they report" or "self-reported." Presenting unverified metrics as fact undermines credibility with knowledgeable interviewers.

**Cross-reference reduction:** If existing research briefs (SMI brief, industry dossier, comparison briefs) cover a topic in depth, cross-reference them in the prep doc rather than reproducing the content. The prep doc should be a quick-scan interview tool, not a second copy of the research.

**Time-boxed compression (F2):** A usable doc beats a comprehensive one. Compute a realistic item budget for the call length (30 min is roughly 2-3 deep stories + 3-4 questions). Put the non-negotiable few at the top (carry-these, the Deep-N stories, the decision-aligned question shortlist); move everything else under an explicit "Depth Bank (only if the conversation goes there)." Tag each kept item with the decision it serves and its job (carry / screen / answer per F1). When in doubt, cut; do not defend volume.

### Step 6: Determine Output Filename and Save

- Use the company slug from Step 1 as the subfolder: `output/<company-slug>/`
- Generate: `output/<company-slug>/MMDDYY-prep.md`
  (company is already in the folder name, omit from filename)
- If file exists, append `-v2`, `-v3` etc.
- Write the compiled document to that path.

### Step 6a: Compliance Gate (MANDATORY — runs before the PDF, never after)

Run the checker on the file just saved:

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 tools/check_prep_doc.py output/<company-slug>/MMDDYY-prep.md
```

**This runs before Step 6b by design.** The PDF is the artifact Nick reads on paper, morning-of. A false send-state claim or a missing reserve proof that reaches the printed page is exactly the failure mode this gate exists to stop — catching it after the render means catching it after he has already read it.

- **Exit 0 (`compliant: true`)** → proceed to Step 6b.
- **Exit 2** → the path is wrong. Fix the path and re-run; do not skip.
- **Exit 1** → **do NOT render the PDF.** Fix the doc, re-save, re-run this step until it exits 0. Each failure names its check:

| Check | Fix |
|---|---|
| 1 / 2 | Add the missing `**Primary proof**` / `**Reserve proof**` line inside THE ONE THING, in the frozen format with a `(domain: <tag>)` tag. |
| 3 | The two domains collapse to one, or a tag is not in the enum. Run `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 tools/proof_domains.py --list` and pick a genuinely different domain — **do not** just relabel the same proof. A reserve in the primary's domain dies to the same exclusion sentence. |
| 4 | A suppressive sentence in Logistics either names no artifact or has no `delivered=true` stamp for the artifact it names. Either generate the stamp (see the Logistics gate above) or **rewrite the sentence** — *"sent \<date\>, no delivery confirmation — offer it again if asked."* Rewriting is usually the correct fix; the stamp is only correct when the artifact genuinely arrived. |
| 5 | A stamp predates the doc. Re-run `outreach_status.py --stamp` with `--as-of` set to the doc's own date and replace it. |
| 6 | A stamp is malformed or v1 (no `artifact=`). Regenerate it; never hand-edit a stamp. |

**Do not fix a failure by deleting the offending line and moving on** when the underlying claim is what matters — a suppressive sentence removed without checking the send-state leaves Nick with no guidance where he previously had wrong guidance. Resolve the fact, then write the line.

If Nick explicitly overrides a failure, note the check number and his reason inline in the doc. An unexplained override is indistinguishable from a skipped gate.

### Step 6b: Render PDF (mandatory terminal artifact)

After the Step 6a gate passes, render a printable PDF as the closing action. Per `memory/feedback_print_prep_pdfs`, Nick reads high-stakes prep on paper.

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 tools/md_to_pdf_doc.py output/<company-slug>/MMDDYY-prep.md
```

This produces `output/<company-slug>/MMDDYY-prep.pdf` (weasyprint, Georgia, multi-page).

Then offer print:

> Generated `output/<company-slug>/MMDDYY-prep.pdf`. Run `lpr output/<company-slug>/MMDDYY-prep.pdf` to send to default printer (recommended for high-stakes calls).

Do NOT auto-print without Nick's confirmation. The offer is the closing beat.

### Step 7: Add Debrief To-Do

1. Read `data/job-todos.md`.
2. Add a new to-do:
   - **Task**: `Debrief after [Company] interview — run \`/debrief\``
   - **Priority**: `High`
   - **Due**: interview date (if known from context), otherwise today
   - **Notes**: `From /prep-interview on [today's date]`
3. Write updated file.

### Step 7b: Advance Pipeline Stage (deterministic — only when this is a scheduled round)

Prepping for a **confirmed, dated** round is a state change: the pipeline row must reflect it. This step closes the gap where `/prep-interview` (a pipeline read-consumer) left the stage stale because it never wrote back. Origin: 2026-06-09 a target company — prep ran the morning the Executive Screen was booked, created the debrief to-do, but left the pipeline reading "awaiting next-step read / nudge the recruiter by 6/13" (a stale gate against booked intel). See `memory/feedback_prep_interview_must_advance_pipeline_on_scheduled_round.md`.

**Gate (this is the only judgment, and a date resolves it):**
- Proceed **only if** the round has a **known/confirmed date** — a date in the context string, or a calendar invite, i.e. the interview is actually scheduled.
- **Skip** (and note why) if: the prep is exploratory / no date is known; the company is not in the pipeline (handled by the `/pipe add` edge case); or the pipeline stage already reflects this exact booked round (idempotent — do not rewrite an unchanged stage).

When the gate passes, advance the row via `pipe_write.py` (atomic; never Edit `job-pipeline.md`):

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python3 tools/pipe_write.py --repo-root . update "<Company>" "<interview-type> booked (<interviewer if known>, <date>)" --next-action "Prep complete; run /debrief after <date>. Hold geography + comp discipline."
```

- Build `<new stage>` from what this run already knows (Step 1 stage + Step 1b round type + interviewer + date). Example: `Executive Screen booked (Jane Doe, Mon 6/15 9:30 AM PDT)`.
- Do NOT overwrite a richer existing next-action with judgment in it unless it's the now-stale gate this round supersedes; prefer advancing the stage + replacing only the superseded gate. When unsure which of multiple roles for the company, use the same match resolved in Step 1.
- Report the before→after stage in Step 8.

## Edge Cases

- **Company not in pipeline**: Proceed with available data. Note: "⚠️ [Company] not found in pipeline — consider adding with `/pipe add`."
- **No coached answers file**: Skip coached answer cross-referencing. Note the gap in all question mapping entries.
- **No company dossier and web search fails**: Proceed with whatever context is available from the pipeline and profile. Flag prominently.
- **Agent fails**: Proceed with remaining agents' data. Note which section is thin.
- **No interview date provided**: Omit date from output. Set debrief to-do due date as "—" (no deadline).
- **Multiple pipeline entries for same company**: If role was specified, use the matching one. If not, use the most recently updated entry. Note which entry was matched.
